    <p>Hi , my name is Marek Radkov. I'm a student in the Software University /SoftUni/ and a member of TEAM "CADMIUM YELLOW". My motto and favourite quote is "You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength." - Marcus Aurelius</p>

<p>That is the basic rule: keep calm, keep coding!<br />
    It is so strange that a coder is writing a code for himself. <br/>
    So for my self I will write only:<br/>
    while (true) {<br/>
    continue;<br/>
    }</p>

<p>My name is Ilian Grekov, I'm living in Sofia. Graduated business administration in 2013. At this moment I'm studing financials in UNWE and software engeneering in SoftUni. I'm programming from 6 months till now. I think that's what I want to do in my life.
    My moto: "Do it different", but many times it goes "do it harder".    </p>
